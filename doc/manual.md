# Manual for ICA-AROMA

## 1 Introduction

ICA-AROMA (for "ICA-based Automatic Removal Of Motion Artefacts") attempts to identify and remove motion artefacts from fMRI data.
To that end it exploits Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the data into a set of independent components.
Based on the results of a [FSL-MELODIC](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC) ICA decomposition, ICA-AROMA automatically
identifies which of these components are related to head motion, by using four robust and standardized features.

The identified motion components are then removed from the data through linear regression in similar way to [fsl_regfilt](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC#fsl_regfilt_command-line_program).

Within the typical fMRI preprocessing pipeline ICA-AROMA has to be applied *after* spatial smoothing, but *prior to* temporal filtering.

Two manuscripts provide a detailed description and evaluation of ICA-AROMA:

## 2 General info

The `icaaroma` package consists of essentially a single python script: `aroma.py`. This can be installed within the package `icaaroma`
or used as standalone script by making it executable and running directly. The `icaaroma` package furthermore contains three mask files
(CSF, edge & out-of-brain) which are required to derive the spatial features used by ICA-AROMA. These need to be installed in a
location accessible to the script: either within the package or in a system location such as `/usr/local/share/aroma`. There is
a `Makefile` included for the standalone installation.

## 3 Requirements

- [FSL](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (either 3.X or 2.7)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/)

The system python/numpy is normally suitable. Otherwise, the [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda) distribution may be used.
This both easy to install and well suited to scientific programming. Nibabel may be installed within anaconda
using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) or (on a neuordebian system) using `apt-get python-nibabel`. FSL commands are expected
to be available in a directory specified by the environment variable `$FSLDIR` (ie `$FSLDIR/bin`) or in the standard location
on neurodebian systems (`/usr/share/fsl/5.0/bin`).

## 4 Installation
From a local clone of the repository on [github](https://github.com/rtrhd/ICA-AROMA):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rtrhd/ICA-AROMA.git
$ cd ICA-AROMA
```
either install as a package `icaaroma` in the system (or other) python
```
$ sudo python setup.py install
```
or as a standalone script `aroma`
```
$ sudo make standalone
```
Either way an executable python script called `aroma` will be installed in `/usr/local/bin`.

To run the package `nose` tests the following may be used:
```
$ make test
```
These include valudation against the results of previous versions.

## 5 Run ICA-AROMA - generic

In normal use, the `aroma` command requires the following five arguments:

|                   |                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|-i, --in           | Input file name of fMRI data (.nii.gz)                         |
|-o, --out          | Output directory name                                          |
|-a, --affmat       | File name of the mat-file describing the affine registration   |
|                   | (e.g. FSL FLIRT) of the functional data to structural space    |
|                   | (.mat file)                                                    |
|-w, --warp         | File name of the warp-file describing the non-linear           |
|                   | registration (e.g. FSL FNIRT) of the structural data to MNI152 |
|                   | space (.nii.gz)                                                |
|-p, --motionparams | File name of the text file containing the six (column-wise)    |
|                   | realignment parameters time-courses derived from               |
|                   | volume-realignment (e.g. MCFLIRT)                              |


Example:

```no-highlight
$ aroma \
    --in func_smoothed.nii.gz --out ICA_AROMA \
    --affmat reg/func2highres.mat \
    --warp reg/highres2standard_warp.nii.gz --motionparams mc/rest_mcf.par
```

The program needs to be able to find the registration files required to transform the obtained ICA components
to the MNI152 2mm template in order to derive standardized spatial feature scores. All output is to the specified
directory. The input fMRI nifti image will not be modified.


### 5.1 Masking

Either the input fMRI data should be masked (i.e. brain-extracted) or a specific mask should be specified (-m, --mask) on the command line.

Example:
```no-highlight
$ aroma \
    --in func_smoothed.nii.gz --out ICA_AROMA \
    --motionparams mc/rest_mcf.par \
    --affmat reg/example_func2highres.mat \
    --warp reg/highres2standard_warp.nii.gz \
    --mask mask_aroma.nii.gz
```

We don't recommend using the mask determined by [FSL-FEAT](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT). This mask is
optimized for use in a first-level analysis, and has been dilated so as to ensure that *all* active voxels are included.
Instead, we suggest creating a mask using the [FSL-BET](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET) Brain Extraction Tool
(using a fractional intensity of 0.3), on a non-brain-extracted example or a mean functional image (e.g. example_func within the FEAT directory).

Example of creating an appropriate mask:
```no-highlight
$ bet <input> <output> -f 0.3 -n -m -R
```

Note that the specified mask will only be used at the first stage (ICA) of ICA-AROMA. The
output fMRI data-file is not masked.


## 6 Run ICA-AROMA - after FEAT

ICA-AROMA is intended for use after the preprocessing of the fMRI data with FSL FEAT and where this has
already been done only the FEAT output directory need be specified using (-f, --feat). In this case the
standard layout of a FEAT output directory is assumed. It is also taken that no temporal filtering has
been applied but that registration to the MNI152 template was performed. ICA-AROMA will select the
appropriate files, create a mask (see section 5.1) and use the `melodic.ica` subdirectory if it is
available (as will be the case if `MELODIC ICA data exploration` option was checked in the FEAT GUI).

Note, however, that in normal use, we don't recommend running MELODIC from within FEAT as it is better
to run it later within ICA-AROMA when a more appropriate mask can be used. The `MELODIC` option in FEAT
is really intended for exploration *after* the full data pre-processing pipeline is complete. It can be
applied after processing with ICA-AROMA, temporal high-pass filtering etc.

Example:
```no-highlight
$ aroma --feat rest.feat --out rest.feat/ICA_AROMA/
```

|-L, --log          | Logging level:  CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO (default) or DEBUG |

### 8.2 MELODIC

When you have already run MELODIC you can specify the melodic directory as an additional input
(`-M`, `--melodicdir`; see example below) to avoid running it again. Note that MELODIC
should have been run on fMRI data prior to temporal filtering but after spatial smoothing.
Preferably, it has been run with the recommended mask (see section 5.1). Unless you have a
good reason for doing otherwise, we advise running MELODIC as part of ICA-AROMA so that it
runs with the optimal settings.

Example:
```no-highlight
$ aroma \
    --in filtered_func_data.nii.gz \
    --out ICA_AROMA --motionparams mc/rest_mcf.par --mask mask_aroma.nii.gz \
    --affmat reg/func2highres.mat \
    --warp reg/highres2standard_warp.nii.gz \
    --melodicdir filtered_func_data.ica
```

### 8.3 Registration

ICA-AROMA is designed (and validated) to run on data in native space, hence the requested
`affmat` and `warp` files. However, ICA-AROMA can also be applied on data within structural
or standard space. In these cases, just do not specify the `affmat` and/or `warp` files. Moreover, if
you applied linear instead of non-linear registration of the functional data to standard space, you
only have to specify the `affmat` file (e.g. `example_func2standard.mat`). In other words,
depending on which registration files you specify, ICA-AROMA assumes the data to be in
native, structural or standard space and will run the corresponding registration step. If you do not
have a `affmat` and/or `warp` file available (if, for instance, the fMRI analysis was performed with
another software package rather then FSL), then theese files should be created using
[FSL-FLIRT](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT/UserGuide) and
[FSL-FNIRT](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FNIRT/UserGuide) respectively.

Example (for data already in MNI152 space):
```no-highlight
$ aroma \
    --in filtered_func_data2standard.nii.gz \
    --out ICA_AROMA --motionparams mc/rest_mcf.par \
    --mask mask_aroma.nii.gz
```

Example (in the case where linear registration to MNI152 space should be applied):
```no-highlight
$ aroma \
    --in func_smoothed.nii.gz --out ICA_AROMA  \
    --motionparams mc/rest_mcf.par \
    --affmat reg/func2standard.mat --mask mask_aroma.nii.gz
```


## 9 Changes from Previous Versions
## 9.1 Command Line
The program is now run directly as the command `aroma` rather as `python ICA_AROMA.py`.
This script may be the single file `icaaroma/aroma.py` if installed standalone with `make` or a stub
referencing the `icaaroma` package if installed with `setup.py` or `pip`.

The following changes have also been made to the command line arguments to conform a little
more closely with the usual gnu conventions.

|   |Former |    Meaning              |   |  V0.4        |
|---|-------|-------------------------|---|--------------|
|-o |-out   |output directory name    |-o |--out         |
|-i |-in    |input fMRI data          |-i |--in          |
|   |-mc    |motion parameters file   |-p |--motionparams|
|-a |-affmat|affine registration      |-a |--affmat      |
|-w |-warp  |warp-file to MNI152 space|-w |--warp        |
|-m |-mask  |mask file for MELODIC    |-m |--mask        |
|-f |-feat  |feat directory name      |-f |--feat        |
|   |-tr    |TR in seconds            |-T |--tr          |
|   |-den   |denoising strategy       |-t |--denoisetype |
|-md|-meldir|MELODIC directory        |-M |--melodicdir  |
|   |-dim   |num dims in MELODIC      |-D |--dimreduction|

In addition, argument filenames no longer have to be absolute paths.

## 9.2 Dependencies
The additional python package `nibabel` is required for reading nifti format files.

## 9.3 Testing
Some `nose` tests of the module are included in `test/test_aroma.py` together with a customized version of `nosetests`.
These included comparisons with results from previous versions of ICA-AROMA. Note, however, that some of these tests will
fail with python 3 as the behaviour of random.sample has changed even with the same seed value.
